## Data

The source of the data (i.e. marathoners times) is _World Athletics_: <https://worldathletics.org/>.

Specifically, the women's marathon times (dating back to 2001) are available in 
the following webpage:

<https://worldathletics.org/records/toplists/road-running/marathon/all/women/senior/2001?regionType=world&page=1&bestResultsOnly=true&maxResultsByCountry=all&eventId=10229534&ageCategory=senior>

Note that the data collection involves web crawling and scraping several pages 
from the above website. 

All the R code used for this task is in the script `web-scraping-world-athletrics.R`,
located in the folder `data/` of this repository.

In this `data/` folder, you'll find various HTML files of the form 
`marathon-women-yyyy.html` where `yyyy` indicates a given year from 2001 to 
2024.
